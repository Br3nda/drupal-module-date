Installation instructions:

1) Install the cck files from http://drupal.org/project/cck.

1) IMPORTANT!! Remove the files date.module and date.install from the cck folder. 
   The files in this module will replace them. If the cck files are not removed they
   will be used instead of the date files in this project and none of the new
   features will be available.
   
2) Upload the date files to a 'date' folder in the modules directory. You should end
   up with a structure like: drupal/modules/date/date.module. You can also place it
   inside the cck folder. Either location will work.

   * Optional * Download the adodb date library from http://php.weblogs.com/adodb_date_time_library
   and add it to the folder. If included, it will allow you to use dates from
   the year 100 to the year 3000. Without it, most date handling is limited to
   1970 to 2038.
   
3) If you already have cck data created, backup your files!! There is a database
   change that may affect them.

4) Go to admin/modules and enable the date module. Be sure to submit the page
   even if the date module is already selected. That will update the path to the files.

5) Go to update.php and select the option to update your database.
   Select the latest update to the date module.
   
6) Go to admin/node/types to view cck content types. Add or select a content type.

7) While viewing a cck content type, select the option to add a new field. Several
   options for date fields should be visible.
   
   ** NOTE ** many people have reported problems viewing newly installed cck fields. If
   you have installed the module and it is not showing up in your field list, manually
   clear the cache table or just pull up an existing field and save it to force the cache
   to update.
   
8) If you already have date fields created from an earlier version, be sure to
   edit each one and save your changes. There are new options available that need to be set.
