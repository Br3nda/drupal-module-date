Installation instructions:

1) Install the cck files from http://drupal.org/project/cck.

1) IMPORTANT!! Remove the files date.module and date.install from the cck folder. 
   The files in this module will replace them. If the cck files are not removed they
   will be used instead of the date files in this project and none of the new
   features will be available.
   
2) Upload the date files to a 'date' folder in the modules directory. You should end
   up with a structure like: drupal/modules/date/date.module.

3) If you already have cck data created, backup your files!! There is a database
   change that may affect them.

4) Go to admin/modules and enable the date module. Be sure to submit the page
   even if the date module is already selected. That will update the path to the files.

5) Go to update.php and select the option to update your database.
   Select the latest update to the date module.
   
   Date module update #4 changes the database structure and updates any existing date data 
   to the new structure. Update #4 has been written so it can be re-run, if necessary.
   If you have used an earlier version of this module and have already processed update #4,
   you should re-run it to ensure the database gets properly updated.
   If in doubt, re-run update #4, it will do no harm, and it will ensure any existing
   data is in the right format.
   
6) Go to admin/node/types to view cck content types. Add or select a content type.

7) While viewing a cck content type, select the option to add a new field. Several
   options for date fields should be visible.
   
8) If you already have date fields created from an earlier version, be sure to
   edit each one and save your changes. There are new options available that need to be set.
