        and handling of from/to dates
#84119  prepare for new default value handling by date module. No changes yet,
        just getting functions and callbacks in place.
#80592  adding from/to date capability, add theming for multiple and from/to
        dates, pull all date form and display elements out into theme functions,
        simplify database handling by making all columns accept null values,
        move validation from the widget to the field. This is step one in the
        process of adding handling for repeat dates. Requires database update.
